# Mock Database Population Testing

This document explains how to test the database population functionality without making expensive OpenAI API calls.

## Overview

The `MockDatabasePopulationTest` class provides three ways to test database population:

1. **Pre-extracted JSON file (Lake Superior)** - Uses the existing `lake-superior.json` file
2. **Test JSON file (Proper format)** - Uses the new `test-lakes.json` file with proper model structure
3. **Generate mock data** - Creates synthetic test data programmatically

## Features

- **No OpenAI API calls** - All data is either pre-extracted or generated locally
- **In-memory database** - Fast testing without external database dependencies
- **Multiple data sources** - Choose from different test scenarios
- **Progress tracking** - Visual feedback during population process
- **Database summary** - Shows final entity counts after population

## Usage

1. Run the test console application:
   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

2. Select "Mock Database Population Test (No OpenAI)" from the menu

3. Choose your data source:
   - **Pre-extracted JSON file (Lake Superior)** - Real regulation data converted to our model format
   - **Test JSON file (Proper format)** - Comprehensive test data in the exact AiLakeRegulationExtractionResult format
   - **Generate mock data** - Programmatically created test scenarios

4. Review the data to be populated and confirm

5. Watch the population process with progress tracking

6. Review the database summary

## Data Sources

### Lake Superior JSON
- Real fishing regulation data for Lake Superior
- Converted from the original PDF extraction format
- Tests the JSON-to-model conversion logic

### Test Lakes JSON
- Comprehensive test data with multiple lakes
- Uses proper AiLakeRegulationExtractionResult format
- Tests all regulation types and edge cases

### Mock Data Generation
- Programmatically created test scenarios
- Predictable data for unit testing
- Covers common regulation patterns

## Benefits

- **Faster development** - No waiting for OpenAI API responses
- **Cost-effective** - No API usage charges during testing
- **Reliable testing** - Consistent, repeatable test data
- **Offline development** - Works without internet connection
- **Comprehensive coverage** - Tests various regulation scenarios

## Error Handling

The mock test handles various error scenarios:
- Missing JSON files
- Invalid JSON format
- Database connection issues
- Duplicate key violations
- Model validation errors

## Original Issue Resolution

This testing approach directly addresses the original duplicate key violation issue by:
- Using consistent, known test data
- Avoiding concurrent data creation issues
- Providing controlled test scenarios
- Enabling rapid iteration on fix validation

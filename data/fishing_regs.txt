TRESPASS LAW
The trespass law applies to all outdoor recreation, including but not limited to: hunting,
boating, fishing, trapping, hiking, and camping. When taking part in any outdoor
recreation, you may not enter legally posted land or agricultural land without permission.
Landowners, lessees, or authorized managers need only post their land once a year. The
signs must be placed at intervals of 1,000 feet (500 feet in wooded areas) or signs may
be placed at primary corners and at access points to the property. Signs must state
“No Trespassing,” or similar words, in 2-inch high letters and have either the signature
or name and telephone number of the landowner, lessee, or manager.
There can be civil or criminal penalties for violation of the trespass laws with maximum
fines up to $3,000 and license revocation. All conservation officers and peace officers
enforce trespass laws.

Guidelines for water access and recreational use

These are simple guidelines and are not intended to address all water access and
recreational use situations. If you have doubts about whether you may be trespassing
on private land, you should ask the landowner for permission.

What is lawful access?

A stream or lake is lawfully accessible if there is a public access, or if public land or a
public road right-of-way borders the surface of the water, or if you have permission to
cross private land to reach the surface of the water. This includes walking in the water
or on the ice regardless of who owns the land beneath the surface of the water.

What waters are open to recreational use?

A stream or lake is open to recreational use over its entire surface if it is capable
of recreational use and if it is lawfully accessible. Any water that will float a canoe
is capable of recreational use, but other waters may also qualify depending upon the
circumstances.

A Message About Invasive Species From
DNR Conservation Officers
Each of us needs to take personal responsibility to
prevent the spread of invasive species!
Minnesota law requires that all boaters and anglers:
• Clean plants and invasive species off all watercraft,
trailers, and other water-related equipment.
• Drain water-related equipment, remove drain
plugs and keep water-draining devices open while

AQUATIC INVASIVE SPECIES
Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are nonnative animals and plants that do not naturally
occur in our waters and may cause ecological or economic harm. See images below of
some AIS that have been found in Minnesota.
You can help prevent the introduction and spread of AIS by following both the required
and recommended actions listed on page 16 before moving your boat, bait or other
equipment from one waterbody to another.
Report new infestations: If you suspect a new infestation of an AIS, note the exact
location, take a photo or keep the specimen, and call 888-MINNDNR.
Invasive carp captures must be immediately reported to the DNR, call 651-587-2781
or email invasivecarp.dnr@state.mn.us. Please take a photo, keep carcass cool but do
not freeze, and make arrangements with the DNR to transport the carp to the nearest
area fisheries office. You may keep invasive carp for personal use with a special permit,
which is available on the DNR website at mndnr.gov/invasive-carp.

Red swamp crayfish

Required Actions—It’s the Law!
Most anglers and boaters follow Minnesota’s Clean, Drain, Dispose
laws to help prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species (AIS):
Clean all visible aquatic plants, zebra mussels and other
prohibited invasive species from watercraft, trailers and other
water-related equipment before leaving any water access or
shoreland.
• It is illegal to transport prohibited invasive species—including
zebra mussels—whether dead or alive.
• You can find a complete list of prohibited invasive species by visiting
dnr.state.mn.us/invasives/laws.html#prohibited.
Drain water-related equipment (boat, ballast tanks, portable bait container, motor)
and drain bilge, livewell and baitwell by removing drain plugs before leaving any water
access or shoreland property.
• Keep drain plugs out and water-draining devices open while transporting watercraft.
Dispose of unwanted bait, including minnows, leeches and worms, in the trash.
• It is illegal to release bait into a waterbody or release aquatic animals from one
waterbody to another.
• It is illegal to release worms in the state; worms are not native to Minnesota.
• If you want to keep your live bait, on shore before leaving, you must always drain all
water from your bait container and refill it with bottled or dechlorinated tap water.

Recommended Actions—Protect Your Waters
The following steps reduce the risk of spreading AIS. This is especially important if your
boat has been in the water or moored for more than 24 hours or if you have recently
been in waterbodies that have zebra mussels or spiny waterfleas.
• Decontaminate watercraft and equipment - find free stations on the courtesy
decontamination page of the DNR website (mndnr.gov/decon).
• Spray watercraft and equipment with high-pressure water or rinse with water if
high-pressure water is not available.
• Dry watercraft and equipment for at least 5 days before using another waterbody.

Lakes and Rivers Listed as Infested
What do I need to do when I visit a lake or river on the infested waters list?

You should follow the same aquatic invasive species regulations: Clean, Drain, Dispose—
every time you visit any lake or river, infested or not.
• If you are harvesting bait, commercial fishing, or diverting or taking water, you
need to follow special regulations in infested waters. See regulations for bait on
pages 38-39.

How do I know which waters are listed as infested?

• For the most complete and current infested waters list, visit mndnr.gov/AIS or
request a copy from AISpublications@dnr.state.mn.us or call 651-259-5100.
• You can use LakeFinder to find out if a particular lake is listed as infested:
mndnr.gov/lakefind.
• Infested waters are posted with orange Invasive Species Alert signs at the
public access.

I will always DISPOSE
of unwanted bait
in the trash.

Pledge to do your part. Protect Minnesota
waters from invasive species.
mndnr.gov/AISPledge

Dispose of unwanted bait in the trash.

Never release bait. Releasing bait is illegal because
it threatens Minnesota’s fisheries. Bait and bait
water can spread fish diseases and invasive species.
All earthworms are nonnative to Minnesota and
damage forests if released.
To Keep leftover live baitfish: (1) bring extra bottled
or dechlorinated tap water with you and (2) on
shore before leaving, you must always drain your
bait container and refill it with the extra water.

Watercraft Inspections
The Minnesota DNR has had a watercraft inspection program since 1992 to help
prevent the spread of AIS. With the help of our partners, today nearly 1,000 authorized
watercraft inspectors are working at lakes and rivers across Minnesota. The information
below will help you prepare for a watercraft inspection. In 2024, 95 percent of boaters
surveyed by inspectors arrived while following Minnesota’s Clean, Drain, Dispose laws.

What should I expect from an inspection?

Inspectors are trained to:
• Introduce themselves as a watercraft inspector.
• Provide tips on how to inspect your own equipment (page 16).
• Physically inspect your boat, trailer and any other water-related equipment—
meaning they may touch your boat or trailer to feel for tiny attached zebra mussels
or other invasive species.
• Physically inspect compartments that may hold water, such as live wells
or bilge areas.
• Deny launch if: 1) the inspector finds invasive species or any plants attached, and
until the invasive species or plants are removed; or 2) you refuse an inspection.
› Although inspectors have the authority to deny launch, they will work with you to
try to bring your watercraft into compliance.
› Inspectors will not deny launch based solely on where, or when, you last used
your watercraft.
• Ask questions to help improve the DNR’s inspection program. You are not required
to answer these questions.

How should I prepare for an inspection?

When entering an access:
• Always follow all state laws regarding AIS and arrive in compliance with Clean, Drain
and Dispose laws (page 16).
• Open the lids of closed compartments that could hold water, like live wells, so the
inspector can see they are drained. Your drain plugs should all be open while you
transport your boat.
• Remember to install the drain plug after the inspection and before launching.
When exiting an access:
• Remove any plants, mud, and invasive animals.
• Pull all drain plugs.
• Open water-holding compartments to allow inspection.

What about watercraft decontamination?

DNR trained inspectors follow specific decontamination protocols using hot water
(120 degrees for at least 2 minutes or 140 degrees for at least 10 seconds) to kill AIS
and, if necessary, using high-pressure water to remove attached AIS. An inspector may
require your watercraft be decontaminated prior to launching or before leaving an
access. Decontaminations are free and most can be done quickly.

How do I find a decontamination station?

The DNR posts decontamination unit locations online at mndnr.gov/decon.
At these sites, inspectors will perform a courtesy inspection and determine if any
decontamination is required.

DEFINITIONS
Culling (sorting)

The act of replacing 1 fish with another fish (see possession information on
pages 40-41). See border waters with North Dakota on page 71.

Daily versus possession limits (collectively called bag limits)

A possession limit is the number of a particular species allowed in an angler’s possession,
including any and all locations such as a livewell or freezer at home. A daily limit is the
number of a particular species an angler is allowed to keep in a calendar day, including
those that are gifted or consumed. Daily and possession limits are most often the same
with the exception of statewide perch limits (see page 30) and special regulations for
sunfish and crappie which reduce a daily limit but retain the statewide possession limit
(see pages 46-64). While on or angling in a water with a daily limit that is lower than the
possession limit, a person may not have more than the daily limit of that species in their
immediate physical possession.

Designated stream trout lakes

These waters have been listed in Minnesota Rule and have been stocked with trout that
are typically found in streams: rainbow, brown, or brook trout. Some also have splake,
a cross between a lake trout and a brook trout.

Game fish

Includes the following and their hybrids: American eel, bass (includes rock, white, and
yellow), burbot (eelpout), catfish, cisco (tullibee), crappie, muskellunge, northern pike,
paddlefish, salmon, sauger, sturgeon, sunfish, trout, walleye, whitefish, and yellow perch.

Immediately released or returned to the water

Immediately released fish are only retained long enough to unhook, measure and
photograph. Fish not immediately released are counted as part of an angler's daily and
possession limit.

Inland waters

Lakes and rivers within Minnesota not bordering Canada or another state.

Minimum size limit

Prohibits harvest of fish less than a specified length.

Minnows

All sizes of true minnows (excluding carp and goldfish), leeches, mudminnows, tadpole
madtoms, stonecats; the following if 12" or less: suckers, redhorses, buffalo, carpsuckers;
the following if 7" or less: bullhead, cisco (tullibee), lake whitefish, goldeye, and mooneye.
Border water regulations may vary.

Native rough fish

Bowfin (dogfish), buffalo, sucker, quillback, carpsucker, redhorse, goldeye, mooneye,
bullhead, gar, and freshwater drum (sheepshead). Border waters regulations may vary.

1-over the size limit

Allows the harvest of 1 fish over a set size limit as part of the daily or possession limit.

Protected slot limit

Prohibits harvest of fish from a designated size range. Fish within this size range must be
immediately released.

Electronic Licensing Information
The Electronic Licensing System (ELS) issues licenses and stamp validations through
1,400 license agent locations statewide.

Instant Licenses

Customers may purchase instant licenses and stamp validations online at
mndnr.gov/buyalicense. An additional convenience fee is added for sales via the
website. Purchasing an e-license on your smartphone or tablet means you won’t
receive a paper copy of your license. Instead, you elect to receive an email and/or print
your valid license.

Lifetime Licenses

First-time purchase of lifetime licenses is only available at the DNR License Center in
St. Paul. Application forms are available online or through the DNR Information Center
888-646-6367. A lifetime license holder who is required by law to have a game and
fish license, must authorize their participation by obtaining an annual license renewal
each year the lifetime license is used. These annual licenses are issued at no fee. Visit
mndnr.gov/licenses/lifetime for more information.

Conservation Licenses

• Conservation Licenses are available only to residents of Minnesota.
• Daily and possession limits are half of what can be taken with a standard angling
license. Fractions are rounded down to next whole number (see page 28 for list).
• People bowfishing, spearing, or using other approved harvest methods under a
Conservation License are limited to one half of the daily and possession limit for
that method.
• Sturgeon harvest tag/endorsement may not be used with a Conservation License.

Trout/Salmon Stamp

© 2025 TROUT AND SALMON STAMP

Trout/salmon stamp validations are printed on the ELS
license. This is the only verification needed to prove
purchase of the trout/salmon stamp. Purchasers may
request the actual pictorial stamp for an additional
75 cents.

LICENSE GUIDE
Do I need a fishing license?

To legally fish in Minnesota, all residents of Minnesota, age 16 through 89, must have a
current Minnesota fishing license unless an exemption applies (see below “Who doesn’t
need a fishing license?”). A self-printed or electronic license is sufficient proof of
licensing. All nonresidents need a license except those younger than 16 do not need a
license if a parent or guardian is licensed. More details can be found on page 27.

Did you buy a 3-year license in 2022?

Three-year angling licenses bought in 2022 are due for renewal.

Who is a resident?

• To qualify as a resident, a person must maintain a legal residence in Minnesota for at
least 60 consecutive days before purchasing a license.
• Residents 21 years of age or older must provide a current Minnesota driver’s
license or Minnesota public safety ID card or have a receipt for an application for a
Minnesota driver’s license or Minnesota public safety ID that is at least 60 days old.
• A nonresident under age 21 whose parent is a Minnesota resident.
• Tribal members with an unexpired Tribal ID, with a Minnesota address, who do not
hold a driver’s license or state ID in any state, and who have not accepted resident
hunting, fishing, or trapping licenses in any other state in the previous 60 days.

Who is a nonresident?

Nonresidents include anyone who does not meet the definition of a resident.

Who doesn’t need a fishing license?

• Residents younger than 16, or residents 90 and older.
• Minnesota residents enlisted in the U.S. Armed Forces, stationed outside the
state, and home on leave (you must carry leave or furlough papers while fishing or
transporting fish).
• Minnesota residents who have served in federal active service outside the U.S.
during the preceding 24 months who are now discharged from overseas duty
(must carry discharge papers while fishing or transporting fish).
• Anyone not requiring a license is allowed to keep a possession limit of fish.

regulations/fishing/exemptions) if they are:
• Foreign exchange students with proof of foreign exchange student status. Available
from any agent.
• Residents 16 and older who have a developmental disability or veterans with a
100 percent service-connected disability. Available only from the DNR by calling
877-348-0498.
• Residents who are legally blind, receiving SSI or SSDI, or receiving worker’s
compensation for total and permanent disability. Must present current letter from

U.S. Postal Service. Must present proof of disability benefits. Available at any agent.
• Residents of a Minnesota licensed nursing or boarding care home, wards of the
Minnesota Commissioner of Human Services, residents of state institutions, or
inpatients of a U.S. Veterans Administration hospital. Must use application available
from the DNR (888-646-6367).

Do I need a license to fish in Minnesota State Parks?

Minnesota residents may fish without a license for any species except trout when:
• Shore fishing or wading on state-owned land within a state park.
• Fishing from a boat or on the ice on water bodies that are completely inside the
boundaries of a state park.
• To fish on a designated trout stream or lake or to harvest trout in a state park you
must have a fishing license and a trout/salmon stamp validation.

What if I’m helping a child fish?

If an adult is showing a child younger than 16 how to bait, cast, and remove fish, no
license is needed. The child must hold the rod, set the hook and reel in the fish.

What if I’m helping someone fish who has a disability?

You do not need a license to assist a disabled person, who must have a valid license
unless an exemption applies. You may only fish with the number of lines allowed for all
licensed or exempt anglers fishing.

Can I get a refund?

Check your license for accuracy prior to leaving the license agent location. All sales are
final. Refunds can only be issued if the:
• Licensee dies before the opening of the licensed season;
• Licensee is unable to participate in the licensed activity because the licensee is
called to active military duty or military leave is canceled during the entire open
season of the licensed activity; or
• Licensee purchased 2 licenses for the same license season in error.

What are license requirements for nonresident youth?

Nonresidents under 16 may either fish under a parent or guardian’s license (including a
family license) or must purchase a nonresident youth license. If fishing under a family
license or their own youth license, youth may possess their own limit; if fishing under
a parent or guardian’s individual license any fish kept are counted towards the parent’s
possession limit.

License Guide

27

What if I lose or can’t find my license?

You can go to any license agent and have them print a duplicate license. The cost is
$2.50, which includes a 50-cent fee charged by the vendor.

What if I’m not a state resident but am a full-time student at a Minnesota school,
college or university?

You may purchase fishing licenses at the resident rate if you reside in Minnesota and
show the license agent a fee statement showing full-time enrollment.

What if I’m not a state resident but serve in the U .S . Armed Forces and am
stationed in Minnesota or the spouse of a Minnesota resident on active
military duty?

By showing proof, you may purchase fishing licenses and stamps at the resident rate.

How can my license be revoked?

• Fishing privileges may be revoked for 1 year for 2 or more convictions of fishing
violations in 3 years. Violations of fishing laws in other states may affect your ability
to fish in Minnesota.
• Violating the gross over-limits penalty provisions can result in privileges being
revoked for 3, 5 or 10 years, depending on the number of fish involved in
the violation.
• Failure to pay fines or to appear in court on a violation can result in revocation of all
game and fish licenses until the fines are paid.

How to Figure Your Bag Limit for a Conservation License
• Applies to bag limits established for inland waters, experimental and special
management waters, and border waters.
• Does not apply to size restrictions, but may only have up to the corresponding
bag limit. For example: a normal limit of 5 fish with 3 over 10" for a Conservation
License would be 2 fish with only 1 over 10".
• Divide the regular limit in half. If necessary, round down to the nearest whole
number. For example: 5 fish regular limit would be a 2 fish conservation limit.
• Conservation licensees are not allowed to keep walleye over 20".

Southern—each with a specific regulation for angling and for spearing. Waters with
special regulations (pages 46-64), and border waters (pages 66-73), are not covered
by the zone regulations and the special regulation is in effect for both spearing and
angling. Details can be found at mndnr.gov/pike.

What is the statewide possession limit for northern pike?

The maximum number of northern pike that you may possess is 10 fish. Zone possession
limits apply to where the fish was harvested, not where it is possessed. For example,
if you live in the North-central Zone you cannot possess 7 pike caught locally and 3
caught from the Southern Zone.

How do possession limits apply to lakes with special regulations on
northern pike?
If the possession limit on a special regulation lake or stream is different than the zone
limit, the special regulation limit applies. For example, if the special regulation limit
is less than the statewide regulation, you may only have 1 daily limit from that lake
included in your possession limit.

TROUT—BROOK, BROWN, RAINBOW AND SPLAKE
The following regulations apply to stream trout species (brook, brown, rainbow, splake)
and their hybrids living in lakes and streams. They do not include lake trout which are
listed under Inland Waters. Lake Superior tributaries (pages 34-36) and Experimental
and Special Regulations (pages 46-64) are also not covered in this section.
Calendar dates refer to 2025 unless noted otherwise. Daily and possession limits are
the same.
Learn more about trout fishing at mndnr.gov/fishing/trout.

General Regulations
• Fishing hours for stream trout on inland waters are from 1 hour before sunrise
to 11 p.m.
• Only 1 line is allowed winter or summer when fishing on designated stream trout
lakes and designated trout streams.
• For legal tackle, more details can be found on page 37.
• Possessing live minnows or using them for bait on designated stream trout lakes
is prohibited. Only dried, frozen, or pickled (brined) minnows are allowed. Live
leeches, worms, and wax worms are legal to use.
• Possessing and using live minnows (and other live bait) is allowed on most trout
streams. However, some streams have specific bait restrictions, check pages 60-64.
• Taking of any species, including catch-and-release angling, in designated trout
waters is prohibited outside of an open season for trout. Any season where trout
can be targeted (harvest or catch-and-release) is considered an open season.
• Taking minnows or leeches from designated trout waters, except under special
permit, is prohibited.
• All stream trout must have head, tail, fins, and skin intact when being transported.
• Native rough fish and common carp may not be taken by spear, harpoon, archery,
or dip net in designated trout lakes or streams. However, dark house spearing
(page 81) is allowed for northern pike, whitefish and catfish.
• The list of Designated Trout Lakes can be found on the DNR website

LAKE SUPERIOR AND ITS TRIBUTARIES
The following regulations clarify the fishing seasons and limits for Lake Superior and the
streams and rivers flowing into it. While fishing Minnesota waters, anglers must follow
Minnesota regulations.

Licensing
Anyone fishing on the Minnesota waters of Lake Superior must possess a Minnesota
angling license and a Minnesota trout/salmon stamp validation except as listed on
page 25. You need a Wisconsin fishing license to fish on Wisconsin waters of Lake
Superior but you may fish the St. Louis River Estuary with a Minnesota fishing license.

Location
• There are different fishing regulations for Lake Superior and its tributaries based
on whether you are above or below a posted boundary, which corresponds to
areas accessible to migratory fish. A list of boundary locations on tributaries can
be found on the DNR website or by contacting an Area Fisheries Office along the
North Shore.
• Some tributary streams have special regulations. Additionally, some streams
have sanctuary areas closed to fishing, including the French, Knife, Lester, Devil
Track and Kadunce rivers, and Gauthier Creek. (See Experimental and Special
Regulations, pages 46-64.)
• Angling from boats is closed October 6 - November 30 on the portion of Lake
Superior from the outermost portion of the north arm of the Duluth ship canal to
the mouth of Chester Creek.

Hours
Angling hours on Lake Superior tributaries below the posted boundaries are from 1
hour before sunrise to 1 hour after sunset. Exceptions are the St. Louis River Estuary
(St. Louis and Carlton counties) and the Pigeon River (Cook County).

Methods
• Anglers are restricted to a single hook or fly only—no treble hooks—on Lake Superior
tributary streams and rivers below the posted boundaries. Exceptions are the
St. Louis River (St. Louis and Carlton counties) and the Pigeon River (Cook County).
• No more than 2 lines may be used on Lake Superior, except only 1 line may be used
within 100 yards of the mouth of any flowing stream.
• On Lake Superior tributaries below the posted boundaries, a fish that is hooked in any
part of the body, except the mouth, must be immediately returned to the water.

Possession and Transportation
• Unclipped steelhead (rainbow trout) must be
immediately released on Lake Superior and its
tributaries. A clipped adipose fin, used to identify
stocked trout, must show a healed scar (see
diagram right). Marking, tagging, or fin clipping
fish and then releasing them without a DNR
permit is illegal.

Possession and Transportation continued
• While fishing or while on the water, trout, salmon, muskellunge, and catfish must be
transported with head and tails intact.
• While transporting fish on land, 1) rainbow, brown and brook trout, and splake must
be transported with head and tail intact; and 2) salmon, lake trout, and walleye may
be filleted but must retain a 1-inch square patch of skin with scales. See pages 41-42
for additional general information on transporting fish.
• Native rough fish or other species not named in the Lake Superior (page 36) section
are subject to inland regulations.

Taking of Smelt
• Smelt may be taken night or day. Artificial lights may not be used to lure or attract
smelt. There is no limit on smelt, and smelt from Lake Superior may be bought or
sold; however, live smelt may not be possessed or transported.
• Dip nets may be used for taking smelt. Minnow seines not more than 25 feet long
or 4 feet deep may be used to take smelt in the St. Louis River and in Lake Superior
when more than 100 feet from the mouth of any stream.
• Taking of smelt at any time is prohibited in the following Lake Superior Tributaries:
French River, Sucker River, Little Sucker River (St. Louis County); Silver Creek,
Encampment Creek, Crow Creek (Lake County).

Taking of Smelt and Cisco (Tullibee), and Trout Eggs, for Bait
• Anglers may take cisco (tullibee) or smelt from Lake Superior or its tributaries
below the posted boundaries to use as bait only on Lake Superior.
• To use cisco (tullibee) or smelt taken from Lake Superior or its tributaries as
bait on other water bodies, the fish must be preserved under a DNR-issued
bait preservation permit. Permit applications are available from the DNR,
500 Lafayette, St. Paul, MN 55155‑4026. Freezing is not a preservation method.
• No other fish species from Lake Superior or its tributaries below the posted
boundaries, or the St. Louis River downstream of the Fond du Lac dam, may be used
as bait except trout eggs (see next bullet).
• Eggs of trout harvested from Lake Superior or its tributaries below the posted
boundaries may be used as bait (spawn bags). Spawn bags from Lake Superior trout
may only be used on Lake Superior and its tributaries below the posted boundaries,
and no other waters in the state.
• Spawn bags can be bought or sold only if they are made from either 1) fish eggs
from a licensed aquaculture facility; or 2) fish eggs taken from a source outside
Minnesota that has been certified disease free and are preserved and labeled
under a Minnesota bait preservation permit. These spawn bags may only be used in
Lake Superior and tributaries below posted boundaries.

Guide Licenses
A guide’s license is required to operate a charter boat for the purpose of guiding
or assisting anglers on the Minnesota waters of Lake Superior and the St. Louis
River Estuary. More information: mndnr.gov/licenses/commercial

TACKLE AND LINES
How many lines can I fish with?

• You may use only 1 line during the open water season except 2 lines may be used
in the Minnesota River downstream of the Granite Falls Dam and in the Mississippi
River downstream of St. Anthony Falls.
• You may use 2 lines through the ice except on designated trout lakes and streams.
• On designated trout lakes and streams, only 1 line is allowed at any time.
• More than 1 line may be allowed on border waters (page 66) and Lake Superior
(page 34).

How many hooks can I use on the end of my line?

• Only 1 artificial bait/lure or 1 single tackle configuration can be used at the end of
your line for it to be considered a single line.
• Up to 3 single- or multiple-pronged hooks may be used as a single tackle
configuration but the total distance between hooks cannot exceed 9" (see below).
• “Umbrella” style rigs may be used provided only 1 wire contains hooks. The other
wires may include lures/baits but cannot contain hooks.
• You may use up to 3 artificial flies on 1 fishing line when you are fishing for bass,
crappie, rock bass, sunfish, or trout. There are no restrictions on distance between
the flies.
• Unless fishing on a designated trout stream or lake, you may add 1 additional
“stinger” hook on a line as part of a single artificial lure or bait. The “stinger” hook
must be within 3" of the artificial lure/bait.

BAIT
Can I use bait in Minnesota waters?

• You can fish with a variety of live or dead bait including worms, night crawlers, insects
and larvae. If you are fishing with minnows or leeches, a number of restrictions apply.
• If you choose to keep your bait when done fishing, you must exchange water in
bait buckets with tap or bottled water prior to leaving any waterbody, except when
you are fishing through the ice. The exception for ice fishing does not apply when
fishing on Lake Superior.
• Dispose of unwanted bait in the trash. It is illegal to release bait into Minnesota
lakes and rivers. All earthworms are non-native and can damage forests if released.
• You can’t use whole or parts of game fish, goldfish, carp, or salamanders (including
mudpuppies) for bait. See page 35 for Lake Superior exceptions.

What are the rules for taking and transporting live minnows and leeches?

• You can't import live minnows or leeches into Minnesota.
• Dead bait may only be imported if it comes from a waterbody tested negative for
Viral Hemmorhagic Septicemia (VHS) with a negative fish health certification or
has been preserved under a DNR bait preservation permit issued to a commercial
license. All imported dead bait must be labeled and the labeling kept on your person
while angling (see website for examples).
• You can take an unlimited number of minnows and leeches with an angling
license for personal use; however you may not transport more than 12 dozen at
a time without a commercial minnow license. All minnows and leeches must be
transported in tap/well or bottled water.

Where can I harvest minnows and leeches?

You can take them from all waters of the state where you can legally access the
water except:
• Within the boundaries of state parks.
• Within designated trout waters, except under permit.
• Most aquatic invasive species infested waters. See mndnr.gov/AIS for a current list.
• All streams and connected waters in Lincoln, Pipestone, Murray, Rock and Nobles
counties south of U.S. Highway 14 and west of U.S. Highway 59 to the South
Dakota border.
• A harvest permit is required to take madtoms and stonecats in Dodge, Freeborn
and Mower counties.

Can I harvest bait from infested waters?

• Minnows and leeches may be taken for personal use from waters infested solely with
Eurasian watermilfoil using a cylindrical trap not exceeding 16" in diameter and 32"
long. At these waters, harvested bait may only be used on the water where taken. The
harvest and use of bait from other infested waters is prohibited.
• Within infested streams and rivers (except for the St. Louis River Estuary), bullhead,
sucker, mooneye, goldeye, and freshwater drum may be taken by hook and line
for personal use as bait on the same water. Harvested bait may not be transported
live from the river or stream. Where a river or stream is divided by barriers such as
dams, fish for bait must be caught and used on the same section.
• You can obtain a DNR permit at mndnr.gov/fishing to take gizzard shad by cast net

Continued on next page

2025 Minnesota Fishing Regulations

888-MINNDNR

for personal use as bait for fishing from Minnesota portions of the Mississippi River
downstream of St. Anthony Falls, the Minnesota River downstream of Granite Falls,
and the St. Croix River downstream of Taylors Falls Dam.

How can I take minnows and leeches?

You can use dip nets, seines and traps. See restrictions below:
• Seines may not be longer than 25 feet nor have bar mesh greater than 1 ⁄4". If the
bar mesh is between 3 ⁄16" and 1 ⁄4", the seine may not be taller than 37", otherwise the
seine may not be taller than 48".
• Traps dimensions may not exceed 30" in length, 30" in width, nor 15" in height. The
diameter of the opening may not exceed 11 ⁄2", and the mesh size may not exceed 1 ⁄2"
bar measure. Traps must have a waterfproof tag bearing the name and address of
the owner.
• You cannot use throw nets (cast nets) without a DNR permit (see page 38).

When do I need to get a commercial license to take and sell minnows and leeches?
• If you want to transport more than 12 dozen.
• If you want to sell minnows or leeches at retail or wholesale.

What are the rules for live suckers?

Suckers 12" and shorter are considered minnows and regular bait rules for minnows
apply. However, suckers longer than 12" may only be transported alive if they are in
containers that are not livewells or other parts of a boat and only if bought from a
licensed commercial vendor. You must have a valid sales receipt from the vendor on
your person.

What are the rules for live bullheads?

• Live bullheads may not be transported north of Minnesota Highway 210.
• Bullheads less than 7" in length are considered minnows and may be possessed in
any quantity south of Minnesota Highway 210. Bullheads must be transported in a
container with a locking lid.
• You may take and possess bullheads, 7-10" in length, for use as live bait. They are
counted as part of your daily and possession limit of 100.
• Legal methods of taking bullheads are dip net, angling or minnow seines.

What is restricted bait and can I harvest and use it?

• Restricted bait includes cisco (tullibee) less than 7", smelt, and VHS-susceptible
species (such as fathead minnows, bluntnose minnows, spottail shiners, and emerald
shiners).
• For restricted bait rules on Lake Superior and tributaries, see page 35.
• Live restricted bait must have been purchased from a licensed retailer (retain proof
of purchase) or come from a VHS-free source.
• Dead restricted bait can only be used if it was harvested from a waterbody tested
for VHS with a negative fish health certification, a VHS free zone (see mndnr.gov/
bait-dead), or has been preserved and labeled under a bait preservation permit
issued to a commercial license.
• All restricted dead bait must be labeled and the labeling kept on your person
while angling (see mndnr.gov/bait-dead for examples).
• Freezing is not a bait preservation method because freezing doesn’t kill VHS.

Where can I get more information about bait?

METHODS
What if people are fishing together from a boat or on shore?

• A party is two or more people fishing together from a single watercraft or on shore
while maintaining unaided visual and vocal contact.
• The number of fish your party possesses can’t be more than the combined limits
of all party members. You may not transport more than your individual daily or
possession limit.

What fishing methods are illegal?

• Intentionally fishing for a species during its closed season.
• Using an artificial light to lure, attract or spot fish. However, you may use a lighted
artificial lure. Batteries used in lighted fishing lures must not contain mercury.
• Leaving your fishing line with hooks attached in the water unattended. Receiving
electronic notifications is not considered attending your fishing line.
• Using explosives, firearms, chemicals (not including a scented bait), spring (or
automatic hook setting) devices that impale or hook fish, or electricity to take fish.
• Taking fish by hand (noodling) or by snagging.

POSSESSION
How many fish can I keep?

• Your daily and possession limits are the same unless otherwise noted. Some waters
have reduced daily limits but statewide possession limits (pages 46-64) which
means an angler can keep 1 limit per day from that water but can't exceed the
statewide possession limit (pages 29-33) at any time.
• A fish is in your possession once you have caught and kept it. Your possession limit
includes any fish you have kept that day plus any fish in storage from a previous day.
• Processed fish (e.g. pickled, smoked) still count towards your limit.
• Culling (page 20) is allowed in most waters except North Dakota border waters and
Mille Lacs (except bass may be culled), until you reach your daily or possession limit.
• Once you reach your daily or possession limit for a species, you may keep fishing
but all fish of that species must be immediately released and no culling is allowed.
If fishing is good you may want to stay below your limit to accommodate keeping a
deeply hooked, legal sized fish.

What are length limits?

Some waters have fish length restrictions, such as slot limits, minimum size limits, or
1-over the size limit. See page 20 for definitions.
You can’t possess any fish outside the legal length limits of the waters on which you are
traveling or fishing, unless all of the following conditions are true: 1) The fish was legally
taken from a connected waterbody or packaged by a licensed fish packer; 2) You are
traveling back to your lodging or docking and taking the most direct route; and 3) You are
not fishing while you are in transit.

What if I’ve caught fish on waters with size restrictions different from statewide
regulations?
• Unless you are in the act of preparing the fish for a meal, any kept fish with size
restrictions different than statewide regulations may not be filleted. Kept fish

must still have their heads, tails, fins, and skin intact so they can be measured and
counted. Carcasses count toward your possession limit until you dispose of them.
• You may eat legal sized fish while on the ice, docked, or moored to shore but you
must retain the carcass including the head, dorsal fin, and tail. Any fish caught and
eaten on the same day count toward your daily limit.

Can I give away fish that I’ve kept?

If you have kept a fish and want to transfer it as a gift, it must be accompanied by a
receipt that must remain with the gift. The person receiving the gift can’t possess
more than the statewide limit including your gift. The receipt must contain all of the
following information:
• Name and address of the owner.
• Name and address of recipient.
• Date of transfer.
• Description of the gift (number and species).
• License number (DNR number or transaction number) under which the fish was taken.

TRANSPORTATION
Can I transport live fish I caught (other than bait)?

No, fish being harvested may not be transported in enough water to keep them alive.
You can't transfer live fish or fish eggs from one body of water to another.

What about fish for an aquarium?

If you are older than 16, you can transport live fish for display in a home aquarium
only if you purchase the fish from an aquaculture licensee and have proof of purchase.
Youth age 16 and younger can legally transport certain live fish for display in a home
aquarium if:
• They have legally caught the fish from among the following species: largemouth,
smallmouth or rock bass; yellow perch; crappie; bluegill, pumpkinseed, green or
orange-spotted sunfish; black, yellow, and brown bullhead.
• No more than 4 fish of each species are transported at any given time.
• All fish are 10" or less in length.
• Fish are not transported in water taken from any lake or stream. You must bring
bottled or tap water for transport.

How do I prepare fish I’ve caught for transport?

• You must package and transport fish in such a way that they can be readily unwrapped,
separated, identified and counted.
• A fish may not be cut into more than 2 fillets.
• If you are transporting lake sturgeon, muskellunge, catfish, splake or brook, brown
and rainbow trout, you must transport them with the head and tail intact so the fish
can be measured.
• Bullhead, sunfish and crappie may be filleted without leaving a patch of skin.
• Fillets from all other species must have a 1-inch square patch of skin with scales
intact from a portion of the body other than the belly, unless they are packaged by
a licensed fish packer.
• Sauger without head and tail intact will be counted as walleye unless they are
packaged by a licensed fish packer.
Continued on next page

General Regulations

41

One of the best ways to transport your fish
so they can be counted and identified is in
clear plastic freezer bags.
Fillets and dressed fish must show at least
a 1-inch square patch of skin with scales so
fish species can be identified.
See page 46-64 for waters with special or
experimental regulations.

OTHER SPECIES
Threatened and Endangered Species
You can’t take or possess any state-endangered or threatened species, including
skipjack herring, crystal darter, pallid shiner, slender madtom, gravel chub, plains
topminnow, black buffalo, pugnose shiner, paddlefish, Blanchard’s cricket frog,
Blanding’s turtle, wood turtle, or endangered or threatened mussels, unless you have
an endangered species permit.

Crayfish
Can I take my own crayfish?

Yes, people with a fishing license and children younger than 16 can take and possess
up to 25 pounds of live crayfish for personal use. However, you cannot possess red
swamp crayfish, as they are a prohibited invasive species (more details on page 15).
A permit is needed to sell crayfish or take/possess more than 25 pounds of crayfish.
More information can be found at mndnr.gov/fishing/commercial.

When can I take crayfish?

From April 1 to November 30. Traps may be left overnight but may only be tended from
1 hour before sunrise through 1 hour after sunset.

Where can I use crayfish as bait?

upstream of the St. Croix Boom Site boat launch, or within Voyageurs National Park.
• Except as noted above, preserved crayfish may be used in all waters of the state and
live crayfish may only be used in the water where they were captured.

Frogs and Salamanders
Can I take my own frogs?

In most cases, yes:
• People with a fishing license and children younger than 16 can take, use, buy and sell
an unlimited number of frogs up to 6" long for bait.
• A special frog license is required to take frogs for any purpose other than bait.
• You must have an endangered species permit to possess Blanchard’s cricket frogs.

When can I take frogs for bait?

From May 16 to March 31 the following year.

Can I release frogs or tadpoles?

42

2025 Minnesota Fishing Regulations

888-MINNDNR

Can I use salamanders (including mudpuppies) as bait?

No. Salamanders are protected wild animals and cannot be used as bait. Several
salamander species including mudpuppies are species of special concern.

Mussels (Clams)
Can I take live mussels?

No. State law prohibits the harvest of live mussels. Of Minnesota's 51 native mussel
species, 24 are endangered or threatened.

Can I take dead mussel shells?

People with a fishing license and children younger than 16 may hand-pick or possess
up to 24 whole shells or 48 half shells from dead mussels of species that are not
endangered or threatened.
• Shell collection is allowed from May 16 through the last day in February the
following year.
• You can’t take mussel shells from the St. Croix River.
• You can’t possess zebra mussels.
• Mussel shells can’t be bought or sold.

Turtles
Can I take my own turtles?

People with a resident fishing license (or youth under 16) and recreational turtle license
can take, possess and transport snapping and western painted turtles for personal use.

What kind of turtles can I take?

• Western painted: between 4 and 5½" in shell length, possession limit 3. Turtles used
in turtle races may be any length greater than 4".
• Snapping: minimum size is 12" in shell length, possession limit is 3. Season is from
July 1 through April 30 the following year.
• All other species of turtles may only be purchased from a commercial vendor.

What about turtle races?

Residents younger than 18 may take, possess, and rent up to 25 turtles for use in a nonprofit turtle race. Each turtle must be greater than 4" in length.

How do you measure turtle shell length?

Measure the top shell length (the hard upper shell of the turtle) from above the neck to
above the tail. The measuring device should measure a straight line above the curvature
of the shell.

How can I take turtles?

You may use traditional angling gear, such as dip nets and hook and line. You may not
use traps, commercial gear, firearms, bows, spears, impaling objects, explosives, drugs,
poisons, lime or other harmful substances to take turtles.

Can I take turtle eggs?

A DNR permit is required to take turtle eggs.

Can I release turtles in Minnesota?

No. Unused or unwanted turtles can’t be released in any Minnesota water.

Where do I get a recreational turtle license?

Licenses can be purchased at any DNR license agent or online at
mndnr.gov/buyalicense.

ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES
• If you catch a fish (including native rough fish and common carp) and you don’t
intend to use it for anything, you must return it immediately back into the water
alive. You can’t waste a fish by discarding it, or any part of it, on the ice, on the bank,
or into the water.
• You can’t dispose of any rubbish (including parts of fish or other animals), or
chemicals into public waters, or on shore.
• You can’t deposit fish parts or other material (chum) into waters to attract fish.
• You can’t possess or transport white perch, ruffe, round goby, black carp, bighead
carp, grass carp or silver carp, unless you are taking them to a DNR office. If you
catch a black, bighead, grass or silver carp, see page 15.
• You can’t buy or sell game fish, native rough fish, whitefish, or cisco (tullibee) unless
you buy the fish from a commercial, private hatchery, or aquatic farm licensee.
• You can't release bait (including worms) anywhere in Minnesota. All unwanted bait
should be disposed of in the trash.
See page 16 for boat and trailer transport restrictions.

PERMITS
A Minnesota DNR permit is required to:
• Transplant aquatic plants, apply chemicals and perform certain types of cutting to
control vegetation in any public water.
• Mark or tag fish and then release them.
• Harvest minnows from designated trout lakes or streams or from most
infested waters.
• Conduct some fishing contests.
A permit from the county sheriff is required for most organized events on the water or
ice, including fishing contests.
Find more information at mndnr.gov/permits or contact your regional Fisheries Office
(page 98).

Federal aid in sport fish restoration

Minnesota’s rich outdoor heritage is enjoyed by all. When you
purchase a fishing rod, reel, or most any other sporting gear,
you pay a federal excise tax. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
grants that money back to the states using a formula based
on fishing licenses sold and the state’s land area. These funds
support fish population monitoring, research, habitat projects,
and efforts related to angler access, recruitment, and retention.

SPECIAL REGULATIONS
INTENSIVE MANAGEMENT LAKES
A number of lakes in Minnesota are managed under both treaties and DNR regulations.
Angling harvest on these intensive management lakes may change throughout the
year to maintain sustainable fish populations. If regulations change, information will be
posted at public boat ramps, the DNR website, and in newspapers.
Mille Lacs Lake including tributaries to posted boundaries (Aitkin, Crow Wing and
Mille Lacs counties). Regulations for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, tullibee,
and other fish species will be posted at public access sites and the DNR website at
mndnr.gov/millelacslake.
Red Lake, Upper including Shotley Brook and Tamarac River (Beltrami County). Those
portions of Red Lake located within the Red Lake Indian Reservation are closed to
non-band members except by special authorization of the tribal council.
• Northern pike: all from 30-40" must be immediately released. Possession limit 3,
only 1 over 40" allowed.
• Walleye: Restrictions or changes will be posted at public access sites and on the
DNR website. A person’s statewide possession limit may not include more than the
current daily limit of Red Lake walleye.

WATERS WITH EXPERIMENTAL AND
SPECIAL REGULATIONS
These regulations differ from statewide or border water regulations and take
precedence. Unless otherwise stated, all general regulations, seasons, limits, border
water regulations, possession, and transportation regulations apply to these waters. If
you want to keep fish with special or experimental size restrictions, the fish must remain
intact to verify it is of legal size until you are preparing to eat the fish. Regulations are
posted at access sites but be sure to also check other sections of this booklet and other
states’ regulations when on border waters. Note: some regulations specify a daily limit
for the lake and others specify a possession limit. See definitions on page 20.
These regulations are intended to improve fishing quality or provide unique
opportunities. The DNR regularly evaluates the regulations and needs your compliance
to ensure success.

National Wildlife Refuges May Have Differing Regulations
Please check with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: 612-713-5360.

Voyageurs National Park
In response to the threat of invasive species introductions, the park only allows
artificial bait in the interior lakes and prohibits the use of privately owned watercraft
and the landing of float planes in these lakes. These regulations do not apply to Rainy,
Kabetogama, Namakan, Crane, and Sand Point lakes. Contact Voyageurs National Park
for more information: 218-283-6600.

BORDER WATERS
This section covers Minnesota’s border waters with Wisconsin, Iowa, North Dakota, and
South Dakota, as well as the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba. It does not
include the waters of Lake Superior, which are not covered under border water rules.
More details can be found on pages 34-36 for Lake Superior. All calendar dates refer to
2025 unless noted otherwise.

LICENSING
What license do I need to fish border waters?

• Minnesota residents must have a Minnesota license.
• Residents of a state bordering that water must have their state’s license.
• Other nonresidents may purchase a Minnesota or the bordering state’s
nonresident license.

Can I fish anywhere on the border waters with a Minnesota license?

• In Canadian border waters, Minnesota residents or nonresidents fishing with a
Minnesota nonresident license, may only fish the Minnesota portion of the Canadian
border waters. To fish the Canadian portion, you must have a Canadian license and
follow Ontario and Minnesota border crossing regulations and processes.
• In other border waters, Minnesota residents or nonresidents fishing with a
Minnesota nonresident license, may fish throughout the defined waters bordering
the two states.

What if I don’t see a particular regulation listed in this section?

Unless otherwise noted, all general regulations relating to angling methods, licensing,
season, limits, fish possession and transportation apply to border waters (pages 37-44).
Also, all fish must be within length limits regardless of where they were caught (more
details can be found on page 40-41). Please check the Experimental and Special
Regulations section (pages 46-64) for different regulations that may apply.

If fishing regulations differ between the border states, what regulations
do I follow?

You must obey the regulations of the state in which you are fishing. More permissive
regulations are limited to that state’s waters.

Can I launch my boat or transport my catch back home from the adjacent state’s
boat launch?
Yes, you can launch your boat and transport your catch by the most direct route back
to the state that you are licensed.

Do bowfishing regulations allowed for inland waters apply to border waters?

The bowfishing regulations covered on page 78 are only allowed on Minnesota’s
portion of the border waters. If the bordering state’s bowfishing regulations are the
same, bowfishers may take legal fish shore to shore under a Minnesota license.

• It is unlawful to possess a spear, spring gaff, or bow and arrow on or adjacent to any
body of water where the spearing and archery season is closed.
• Spearing game fish is unlawful except northern pike (season and limit in table
below) and catfish may be speared from a dark house. For other rules regarding
dark house spearing, ice angling, and ice shelters see pages 81-83.
• Catfish may not be taken by spearing anytime on the Bois De Sioux River from
White Rock Dam to the North Dakota border.
• Culling is not allowed on the Bois de Sioux River from the White Rock Dam to the

Aquatic Plant Permit Requirements
Water plants such as bulrushes are essential for healthy lake ecosystems. They
reduce wave erosion, provide fish and wildlife habitat, and purify water. Because
lake plants can interfere with swimming and boating by lakeshore owners—but are
also vital to lake health—the DNR allows removal under the following conditions.

DNR permit is NOT required to cut or pull submersed (underwater) plants
as long as:
• The area does not extend along more than 50 feet of your shoreline or
one-half the length of your frontage, whichever is less;
• The total area is less than 2,500 square feet (except for boat channels); and
• The plants are immediately and permanently disposed of on high ground
where they can’t re-enter the water.

DNR permit IS required to:

• Remove emergent plants (such as bulrushes, cattails, and wild rice).
• Use herbicides or algicides in Minnesota lakes.
• Install or use an automated device such as the Crary WeedRoller®
• Remove water lilies (other than in a narrow channel extending to open water).
• Remove plants in an area larger than 2,500 square feet or wider than 50 feet.

A person who illegally destroys plants can be cited and made to pay for the
restoration of those plants.
For more information, call your regional DNR office (page 98) or visit our website
at mndnr.gov/apm/aquatic-plant-management-permits.

What species of fish can I spear from a dark house?

Northern pike, catfish, and whitefish may be speared but only if using a darkhouse.
Native rough fish (including gar) and carp may be speared in or outside of a darkhouse.
See page 79 for native rough and carp spearing seasons as they differ.

What is a dark house?

Any structure that is darkened to view fish under the ice. Holes in the ice are cut inside
these structures so fish can be speared. Please mark your holes upon leaving.

Do I need a license to spear from a dark house?

Residents age 18 through 89 and nonresidents age 18 and older need a spearing license
and an angling license. Youth age 16 and 17 need an angling license only.

What methods can I use while spearing in a dark house?

• You may fish with 1 additional line but any fish caught must be landed immediately
and not left out as a decoy.
• You cannot use artificial lights to see fish or attract fish when spearing.
• You can use lighted decoy fish powered by a battery not containing mercury.
• Any visual backdrop material used must be retrieved by the end of your trip.

If more than 1 person is spearing in a dark house, how many fish can you spear?

Party fishing does not apply to spearing. Each person can only spear their own fish.

Dark House Spearing, Ice Angling and Ice Shelters

81

Where can I spear fish in a dark house?

Most inland waters. Only Baby Lake (Cass County) is closed to dark house spearing.
Native rough fish may not be taken while dark house spearing in designated trout lakes.
For border waters, more details can be found on pages 66-77.

ICE ANGLING
How many lines can I use through the ice?

2, except on designated trout lakes and streams you can only use 1 line.

How far away can I go from my lines?

You must remain within sight of your line. If you’re using a tip-up (a device with spooled
line and a flag that pops up to indicate when a fish bites) you need to be within 200 feet.

Does ice fishing have any other regulations that differ from open water fishing
besides the number of lines I can use?
No, anglers must follow all general and special regulations.

ICE SHELTERS
What is a shelter?

A fish house, dark house, or other structure that is set on the ice to provide shelter.

What is a portable shelter?

A portable shelter is a shelter that collapses, folds, or is disassembled for
transportation. Portable shelters do not include trailer/campers with or without
slide-outs.

Do I need a license for my fish house or dark house?

• All shelters, except portable shelters, placed on the ice in inland and Canadian
border waters need a shelter license.
• However, portable shelters in inland and Canadian border waters need a license if
a person leaves the portable shelter unattended any time between midnight and
1 hour before sunrise, or is not within 200 feet of the portable shelter.
• Shelters must be licensed by the owner of the shelter.
• A shelter license is not required on the border waters between Minnesota and
Wisconsin, Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota.
• A shelter license is valid from March 1 through April 30 of the following year.

Do I need any kind of identification on my shelter?

All shelters need identification, except portable shelters that are occupied. Occupying
a shelter means staying within 200 feet of it. Identification means:
• One of the following: owner’s name and address; owner’s driver’s license number;
or owner’s Minnesota DNR identification number.
• Identification must be readily visible from the exterior of the shelter with
characters at least 2" high.

Where can I place my shelter?

• Anywhere on Minnesota waters. Shelters must be no closer than 10 feet apart.
• In the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) you can use a shelter but
must remove it from the ice each night and each time you leave the BWCAW.

82

2025 Minnesota Fishing Regulations

888-MINNDNR

Are there any regulations about shelters I must comply with?

Any shelters on the ice overnight must have at least 2 square inches of reflective
material on each side.

Are there different shelter regulations for border waters for adjacent states?

If you are on border waters between Minnesota and Wisconsin, Iowa or North and
South Dakota, the regulations for the state that issues your fishing license apply for
your shelter.

Does the trailer I use to haul my fish house, fishing equipment or fish house on
wheels need to be registered?
Yes. See your local deputy registrar for trailer registration.

Can I use a fish shelter after the removal date?

Yes. After removal dates, shelters may remain on the ice between midnight and 1 hour
before sunrise only when occupied or attended.

What happens if I don’t remove my shelter before the deadline?

The owners of the shelter will be prosecuted, and the structure and contents may be
confiscated or destroyed by a conservation officer.

Can I leave my shelter on a public access site after I take it off the ice?
No.

Can I place or leave any items, including fish, on the ice outside my shelter?

You can store non-garbage related items outside your shelter such as coolers, storage
containers, food and beverages that haven't been consumed, and other supplies and
equipment. However, garbage, debris, dead animals, human or pet waste, or any other
item that would be considered litter if left behind, may not be placed outside a shelter
directly on the ice. All garbage, waste, and dead fish must be placed in a container that
is secured to a shelter or sled.

Shelter Removal Dates
All shelters must be off the ice no later
than midnight for each of the dates
given in the following categories below.

Inland Waters

Dates of removal are determined
by an east-west line formed by U.S.
Highway 10, east along Highway 34 to
Minnesota Highway 200, east along
Highway 200 to U.S. Highway 2, and
east along Highway 2 to the Minnesota–

Knowing what fish species you are catching is not only fun, but in many cases it’s
required by law. It is particularly important to know how to distinguish walleye from
sauger (and saugeye), to know the difference between northern pike and muskellunge,
and to be able to tell what species of trout or salmon you catch.

How to Measure the Total Length of a Fish
To determine the legal length of a fish, lay it flat on its side, pinch or squeeze the
tail to maximize length, and measure from the nose or jaw, whichever is longer, to
the farthest part of the tail when fully extended.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Boat and Water Safety
Everyone on your boat needs to have an accessible, U.S. Coast Guard-approved life
vest of the proper size and type. In addition, if the boat is 16 feet or longer, there must
also be an approved throwable device such as a boater’s seat cushion or ring buoy.
Children under the age of 10 must wear a life jacket on board any boat underway.
Underway means not attached to a permanent mooring or tied to a dock. There are
exceptions to the law for: children who are below the top deck, or in an enclosed
cabin, or on a boat operated by a licensed captain, or on a boat that is anchored for the
purpose of swimming or diving.
It’s always a good idea to wear your life jacket. Most fatal boating mishaps occur
when boats capsize or people fall overboard, especially on small boats. These types of
accidents can happen even on calm waters, while traveling at slow speed or stopped.
For a complete summary of the boating regulations and safety information, contact the
DNR Information Center for a copy of the Minnesota Boating Guide, or find it online
at mndnr.gov/safety/boatwater. For rules pertaining to the use of motorboats within
Wildlife Management Areas, refer to the Minnesota Hunting and Trapping Regulations
Handbook or call the DNR.

9 out of 10 boating deaths
could be prevented
by wearing a life jacket.

Aquatic Management Areas
The DNR Fish and Wildlife Division acquires land along lakes and streams to protect
critical fish habitat and to provide fishing opportunities. These areas, known as Aquatic
Management Areas (AMAs), have specific use types (easement, restricted use and
general use) and are posted with signs that indicate allowable and unauthorized uses
for each use type. As a reminder it is always unlawful to leave any personal equipment,
such as tree stands, unattended on AMAs. For more information on AMAs please go to
the AMA Finder at: mndnr.gov/amas.

Catch-and-Release
Catch-and-release fishing offers anglers a way to enjoy their sport with less harm to
the resource.
• Do not plan to release fish that have been on a stringer or in a livewell.
• Play and land the fish quickly.
• Don’t angle for fish in very deep water, unless you plan to keep what you catch.
Fizzing of fish, or the act of inserting a needle into a fish intended to deflate the gas
bladder, caught from deep water can do more harm than good and is discouraged.
• Handle the fish gently and keep it in the water as much as possible.
• Do not hold the fish by the eye sockets or gills, but rather by the lower lip or under
the gill plate and also support the belly of the fish.
• Wet your hands before touching a fish to prevent removing its protective coating.
• If a hook is deeply embedded, cut the line so that at least 1" hangs out of the mouth.
This helps the hook to lay flush when the fish takes in food.
• Circle hooks may help in reducing deeply hooked fish. They are made to hook fish in
the mouth.
• A fish that can be legally kept should not be released if it is bleeding heavily, which
indicates its chance of survival is poor.
• You cannot target a species during its closed season, even if you plan to release it.

Managing Minnesota’s Fisheries
The DNR Fish and Wildlife Division is responsible for managing the state’s diverse
fisheries resources (4,500 fishable lakes and 16,000 miles of fishable streams).
Each year, roughly 1.7 million people fish in Minnesota, and sport fishing generates
approximately $6 billion in direct expenditures, making angling one of the state’s
largest industries.
Much of Minnesota’s fisheries program is reimbursed by the Federal Aid in Sport
Fish Restoration Program (federal excise tax), administered by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service.

Master Angler Program
The Fishing Hall of Fame of Minnesota in partnership with DNR recognizes anglers who
catch large fish of various species. Categories include adult, youth, and catch-and-release.
For more information on becoming a Master Angler, visit the DNR website or
fishinghalloffamemn.com

Conservation Partners Legacy Grant Program
The program provides funding for projects to restore, enhance, and protect
Minnesota’s fish, game, and wildlife habitat. See mndnr.gov/cpl for details.

STATE RECORD FISH PROGRAM
Minnesota’s State Record Fish Program generates excitement among anglers, the
public and the media! Records are maintained for the species listed in categories
below. No additional species or hybrids are currently being added to the state record
fish program. State record fish applications and instructions are available on the DNR
website at mndnr.gov/recordfish. Minimum lengths and weights are established for
all open categories (details here). Any incomplete applications will not be accepted.
Species identification must be verified by DNR Fisheries staff and must be able to be
verified by a scientific key (link available online).

How Do I Submit an Application?
Complete rules for catch-and-release and certified weight record fish submissions and
applications are available on the DNR website at mndnr.gov/recordfish. To be eligible
for a state record, the fish must be caught in a public body of water during open
seasons by an angler with a valid angling license. The application must be submitted
within 90 days of the catch. Record fish submissions must include photographs or
video of the fish, with clear identification of species characteristics. Photographs
or video must show the full length of the fish on or next to a clearly marked
measuring device, with the snout of the fish on zero and the tail pinched for accurate
measurement, and the weight measured on a certified scale (found at most shipping
stores and grocery stores). Catch-and-release record submissions should also include
photos or video of the fish being released unharmed. Harvested fish must be brought
to a DNR Fisheries office for species confirmation (locations are listed on the DNR
website). DNR does not keep line class records.

Catch-and-Release Records
The following is a complete list of Minnesota’s state record catch-and-release fish,
including lake (county) where the fish was caught and released unharmed. Lengths are

HEALTH ADVISORY AND FISH
EATING GUIDELINES
Most fish are healthy to eat and are a great source of protein, healthy fats (Omega-3s),
and important vitamins, but any fish (store-bought or sport-caught) could have
contaminants such as mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that can harm
human health—especially children and fetuses. The Minnesota Department of Health
lets people know how often fish can be safely eaten.
The guidelines on the following page are based on contaminants measured in fish from
lakes across the state. For more information, call the Minnesota Department of Health
at 651-201-4911, toll-free at 800-657-3908 or visit health.state.mn.us/fish

Tips for safe fish eating
• For consumption advice on individual waters that have been tested visit
mndnr.gov/lakefind.
• Older and larger predator fish (walleyes, northern pike, lake trout) contain more
mercury—eat smaller predators.
• Eat more panfish (sunfish, crappies) and fewer fish that eat other fish (walleyes,
northern pike, lake trout).
• PCBs accumulate the most in fatty fishes such as carp, catfish, and lake trout.

Consejos para el consumo saludable de pescado
• Los peces depredadores mayores y más grandes (Lucioperca, Lucio Norteño, Trucha
de Lago) contienen más mercurio, comen depredadores más pequeños.
• Coma más peces como Pomosios y Pez Sol y menos pescados que comen otros
peces como Lucioperca, Lucio Norteño y Trucha de Lago.
• Remueva la piel y la grasa, especialmente la grasa alrededor de la barriga. También
coma menos pescados que tienen más grasa como Bagre, Carpa y Trucha de lago.

Tej yam qhia noj ntse kom txhob muaj teeb meem
• Cov ntses loj xws li (walleyes, northern pike, lake trout) nws muaj cov kua hlau ntau
nyob rau hauv nws lub cev, yog li nej yuav tsum noj cov ntses me.
• Noj cov ntse pluav xws lis (xafiv = sunfish, kabpib = crappies) thiab yog cov ntse uas
tom lwm yam ntse no ces noj kom tsawg xws lis (vaulais = walleyes, novtaw phaij =
northern pike, lej rhauj = lake trout).
• Yim cov tawv thiab roj, qhov tseem ceeb tshaj yog cov roj tawm npluag plab. Tsis
tag lis xwb yuav tsum noj cov ntse rog kom tsawg lis tsawg tau xws lis pamnais, ntse
tuajkub, thiab (lej rhauj = lake trout).

• Cá lỏ́n và trưởng thành chủ́a nhiều chất ô nhiễn (mercury). Thì dụ như cá walleye,
cá hồi, cá trê.
• Nên ăn loại nhỏ cỡ như cá Rô (sunfish), cá hồi (lake trout).
• Không nên ăn da và mỡ cá, nhất là phâ n
̀ mỡ ở bụng cá. Mặt khác, nên ăn ít
những loại cá có nhiều mỡ như cá chép, cá trê hoặc cá bông lau, và cá hồi.

MINNESOTA FISHING REGULATIONS
The following updates were made after the fishing regulations handbook was printed.
The updates are summarized below. See the page listed for the detailed change.

March 4, 2025
Page 30. Beginning March 1, channel and flathead catfish are no longer counted
together in a possession limit. The possession limit for channel catfish is 5 (only 1 over
24") and the possession limit for flathead catfish is 2 (only 1 over 24"). The possession
limit for whitefish and cisco (tullibee) is not in aggregate, each fish has its own
possession limit. The possession limit for both species applies to fish over 7".
Page 49. The daily limit for sunfish on Deer Lake including Otter Tail River (Otter Tail
County) is 10 but was incorrectly listed as 5.
Page 69. The walleye and sauger limit for Saganaga Lake is 3 (only 1 walleye over 20"),
the 17" minimum size limit has been repealed but was incorrectly still included in
this table.
Page 77. The end date for the catch-and-release lake sturgeon season in fall and winter
for the St. Croix River downstream of Taylors Falls Dam to mouth including Lake
St. Croix is March 1, 2026. It was incorrectly listed as March 1, 2025.

March 17, 2025
Page 13. The 2026 stream trout (streams only) season open date is April 11, 2026. It
was incorrectly listed as April 1.
Page 16. The regulations for bait are listed on pages 38-39. The page range was
originally listed as 39-39.
Page 30. The season for American eel is continuous and the possession limit is catchand-release only. The season was originally incorrectly listed as “no open season.”
